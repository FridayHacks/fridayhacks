In today's hack, we worked on giving the [OpenNEAR](http://opennear.org/) project some color and personality.
We started by creating a simple logo with the awesome website [LogoMakr](https://logomakr.com/)

The basic logo now looks like this

![Logo]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/opennear.png)

It is simple and elegant. Then, we built a simple website using Bootstrap and Github
pages. Nothing too complicated. It is very simple static website:

![Website]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/opennear_website.png)

Now the have some small branding going on, it is time to get to work and get
things done.
