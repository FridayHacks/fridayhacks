Today, we built a slide presentation template using the Reveal.js framework. This
framework is great for HTML-based presentations and it is a great hack for any
technical speaker for the following reasons:

1) **It is browser-based**: you don't need Power Point or Keynote to deliver your
presentation (but you would need an internet connection)  
2) **Is is great for showing code**: you can display code in a nice and concise way  
3) **It has an additional functionality**: you can move up/down and left-right. So,
you can better define the sections of your presentation  
4) **It is highly customizable**: you can add bell and whistles or all sorts in custom
css and js files.

Here is the [template](https://github.com/paiva/revealjs-presentation-template):

[![Reveal.js Template]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/revealjs.png)](http://santiago.io/revealjs-presentation-template/#/title)

Basically, every slide is a considered a section: `<section> I am a slide </section>`,
and then you can treat every single slide as a HTML page.
