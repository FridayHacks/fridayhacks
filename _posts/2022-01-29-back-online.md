After a couple of years of being offline and inactive, we are making efforts
to bring FridayHacks back online. We have been updating Ruby and other Jekyll
dependencies and we have been able to fix some issues blocking us from posting. 

We want to continue our original mission of trying out and explorining different
technologies on Friday nights with the purpose of learning and discovery. We
have not been consistent with this goal these past years, it is has been mainly
associated with a lack of organization and planning. One of the important points
to highlight is that we will try to be more organized and try to schedule 
sessions in advanced. We have an extensive list of projects and ideas we want to try,
and we have not been able to cross any item of the list. We want to change that this
year. We are excited to slowly bring this site to its full momentum and we will include
livestreams in the near future.

Time to build.
