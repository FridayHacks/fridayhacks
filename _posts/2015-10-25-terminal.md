In the spirit of improving our development sandbox, we set out to look for a better gnome terminal experience. We started out with this boring bash shell terminal:

![Old Terminal]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/terminal_old.png)

The end result looks as follows:

![New Terminal]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/terminal_new.png)


This new shell provides you with a more flamboyant experience by integrating Tmuxinator with Oh-My-Fish

### Tmuxinator

Fist step install Tmuxinator

```ruby
gem install tmuxinator
```

Then, depending on your default editor, you will have to specify

```bash
export EDITOR='vim'
```

Create new project with

```bash
tmuxinator new [project]
```

where `[project]` is the given name to your Tmuxinator project.

Start a session with

```bash
mux [project]
```

Look at the sample `~/.tmuxinator/project.yml` file to give you an idea of what you can do in different 'windows'. In our case, we are creating 3 windows, one for personal development, one for work, and one for the localhost server. You can get creative. For example, you could auto start 3 windows and launch Vagrant. Since my default shell is still bash, we specify in the panes option to start the fish shell.

### Fish & Oh-My-Fish
To install Oh-My-Fish, you need to install Fish shell v2.1.0 or above. First, let's install Fish. Fish stands for Friendly Interactive Shell. Go to [fishshell.com](http://fishshell.com/) and select your OS. For us, it is Ubuntu, so we downloaded the `.tar.gz` file, then

```bash
	tar -xzf fish_2.2.0.orig.tar.gz
	cd fish-2.2.0
```

Apply the Autotools Build

```bash
	autoconf
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install
```

If everything worked, you should be able to start your fish shell on your terminal with `$ fish` command, you will see that the shell looks different. To go back to bash, simply type `~> bash`. Fish has very interesting features such as autocompletion. That is time saved and you reduce then number of keystrokes.

Next we want to install the Oh-My-Fish framework for managing the Fish configuration

```ruby
curl -L https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish/raw/master/bin/install | fish
```

To play with the style and colouring, you need to install a theme. You can browse themes [here](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/). In our case, we went ahead with the theme `bobthefish`

```ruby
omf install bobthefish
```

This theme is powerful for Git as they use the Powerline to show lots of relevant information to you once you are working in a Git repository.

The final step is to install `Powerline` and a font. This part is very tricky and we would recommend to read the official documentation on how to do it:
