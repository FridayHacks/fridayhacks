This Friday, we went for a simple hack: writing a simple "Launching Soon" website for [Polydigital](https://polydigital.io/), hosted via Github Pages.

Polydigital is an upcoming startup that focuses in Web3 and dWeb technologies, specially on both the Ethereum and Handshake blockchains. We wanted to come up with a very simple and elegant design. We decided to try the "WeBuild" template fom BootstrapMade (which we have a  license).

The template was very easy to use and the original version looks like this:

![WeBuild Template]({{ site.url }}/images/webuild.png)

We removed some unnecessary information such as the countdown and the contact-us form, to keep it more simplistic and give it a "Stealth Mode" vibe

We added Polydigital's logo and we looked for a royalty-free red background image that can transmit the concept of "poly" or "multiple", and the first idea that came to mind was to implement a 3D version background containing some polygons. We found this amazing design on Pixabay and we went with it

![Red Triangles]({{ site.url }}/images/red_triangles.png)

The final (prototype) design came together as follows: 

![Polydigital Prototype]({{ site.url }}/images/polydigital_prototype.png)

Now, it is important to point out that the background image does not look very well for large-sized screens. For instance, it does not look great on a 34" screen (as the image is more for square-type of windows), but it does look great on mobile phones. Another important part to mention is that the logo resizing needs work. It looks ok on a big screen, but too small on a mobile phone. Not a big deal, but it is something to fix in the future. 

Finally, we added a contact button showing the contact email and we left plenty of space for Social Media links.
