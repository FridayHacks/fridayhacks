This week we focused on monitoring infrastructure. We decided to test an uptime monitoring solution with [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) 

![UptimeRobot]({{ site.url }}/images/uptimerobot-logo-dark.svg)

UptimeRobot offers a free tier account where you can set up to 50 monitors. Each monitor can perform one of the following operation: check HTTP(S) of a website, check if a keyword is present in the code of a website, ping an IP  (or host), check port, or check heartbeat of a site

Then, you can specify to set the alerts to email and phone notifications. UptimeRobot also has an app on both the AppStore and GooglePlay

We have added a total of 11 monitors (different websites to check) with the goal of seeing if they go down. We will then test the ping option and the port option
